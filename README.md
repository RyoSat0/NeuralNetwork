# Overview 
Built a neural network from scratch using only NumPy in Python, achieving a 95.45% accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits.

# Vision 
Humanity has evolved over the course of long history, taking countless years to reach where we are today. Throughout this long journey, there have been events that accelerated human progress at extraordinary speeds—such as the utilization of fire, the development of language, the Industrial Revolution, the invention of electricity, and the spread of the internet. Now, is the evolution of AI one of those events? If so, being born in an era where such a transformative event is happening fills me with excitement. At the same time, I feel that not pursuing this field would mean missing out on something significant. As I thought about this, I began to grow curious about AI—how neural networks work, how they learn, and how they "think." This curiosity led me to start studying neural networks by reading Michael Nielsen's online book, [neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
